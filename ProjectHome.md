**This project is no longer maintained by Patrick Balleux...**

**Currently we are looking for:**
  * **_Java developers_** to help in the coding of the project.
  * **_Designers_** to help in the designing of the UI, themes, icons etc of the project.
  * **_Translators_** to help in the translation of the UI and user documentation of the project.

WebcamStudio is a virtual webcam software that can be used with [Skype](http://www.skype.com) or a flash website like [UStream](http://www.ustream.tv), to create a professional looking broadcast, including banners, animations, transit animations and icons, etc...

This tool is not meant as a video editor but as a live video mixer giving you the possibilities to change the look of the broadcast on the fly.


# Features #
Some of the features include:
  * Switch webcams on a single click
  * Show an IRC channel in your video broadcast
  * Broadcast your desktop for creation of nice HOWTO's
  * Be creative and put animations and banners
  * Display what song is currently played by Rhythmbox
  * Co-host a remote friend, show his webcam inside your output (_PicInPic_)
  * Connect to [WeatherBug](http://www.weatherbug.com/) and display your current weather
  * Apply some fancy effects on each source
  * Have a green wall, then why not use the ChromaKey effect to do the same as the weather man on the news network
  * Use all kinds of devices as webcamera like a MiniDV, your iPhone, etc....

More features to come.
